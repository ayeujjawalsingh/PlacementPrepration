a. @while  
b. @if  
c. @for

```css
Answer: c. @for
```

**Explanation:** The @for directive allows you to generate styles in a loop. The @for directive comes in two forms. The first option is @for $var from `<start>` through `<end>` which starts at `<start>` and loops "through" each iteration and ends at `<end>`. And the second option is @for $var from `<start>` to `<end>` which starts at `<start>` and loops through each iteration "to" `<end>` and stops. Once the directive hits the `<end>`, it stops the looping process and does not evaluate the loop that one last time.
